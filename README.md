1) Run MainRunner for data services (ports in use are 8001, 8002, 8003)
2) Run "ng serve -open" from angularclient folder

notes: 
click buttons on page, "enter" button action not implemented <br>
security works on service side only, it was commented out <br>
so security does not work with angular client at the moment
